In case you missed this: Meta just released a new open source library called [LTVision](https://github.com/facebookincubator/LTVision) that should help advertisers in analysing the potential pLTV opportunity in advertising and user acquisition.

In this context, pLTV stands for predicted lifetime value of customers or users of services, apps, games, eCommerce and such. For example Meta could optimise marketing campaigns towards users with high predicted lifetime value instead of e.g. installs, first purchase value or cumulative revenue until the 7th day (D7 revenue).

This of course requires a pLTV model that utilises the best available data – data that typically is available for the advertiser but not necessarily to platforms such as Meta.

LTVision is written in Python, unlike some of Meta's earlier marketing related packages such as Robyn, although they are working on a Python version of Robyn as well, which is nice. 

The initial release contains the first "Module" that focuses on data analysis tools and guides for estimating the feasibility and business opportunity in pLTV optimized user acquisition.

Especially the documentation of the business opportunity and methods related to it can be as if not even more valuable than the code inside the package. Just look at the Analysts's Guide to MMM offered by Robyn. Towards this end, LTVision offers a white paper and an example notebook.

This indeed does appear to be just the first step for the package but I am very happy to see that it is actually open source, unlike some other marketing measurement libraries that are advertised as open source software – looking at you, Google Meridian.
