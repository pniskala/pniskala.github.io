 [Up down up](https://www.updownupbook.com/) is a games business book by Kim Nordström. The official website advertises the book as follows:

>Ever wonder why some game companies succeed while others fail? This book explains why. Games industry veteran Kim Nordström spent two years talking to more than 100 of the industry's most experienced founders and CEOs, about lessons learned and wisdom gained from their biggest wins and most disastrous failures. This book tells you what you need to know about success - and failure - in video games.

### My take on Up down up

To be completely honest, I had no idea who Kim Nordström was the first time I saw the book but that is more of an offense towards myself than him. Kim has an impressive resume having worked at key roles in companies such as King and Paradox Interactive.

Up down up combines general business wisdom from books such as Good to great and industry insights from Kim's own experiences and extensive interviews with a long list of experienced leaders in gaming. These ingredients are applied to describing the fundamental building blocks of game studios and the different stages they go through in their lifespan. I feel the industry interviews and insights are biased towards the Nordics but that is natural given the scope of the book and Nordström's background.

As a business book, Up down up is definitely directed towards industry professionals who probably are thinking about founding their own company and leaders who want to gain insights into managing their current business.

I do not really fall into either of the categories but I still found it interesting to read what e.g. Ilkka Paananen of Supercell has to say about company culture. Definitely many of the learnings are generic enough that one could apply them to other industries as well – culture plays a big role in most successful companies, and concepts such as the magical pairs or the horizon model are not exclusive to games industry.

The interviews and other industry insights are definitely the highlight of Up down up. There's lots of information in the book but the chapters are short enough and spruced with snippets from the interviews, making it a nice read. At the same time, the book does not go very deep into the any single topic.

Like most business books, Up down up sprinkles some science here and there from the likes of Daniel Kahneman but that is not the main foundation of the book. It does list the people that have been interviewed but there's for example no list of books that have been used as the source material although some are mentioned clearly by name in the text.

The audiobook version of the Up down up is excellent. I originally bought the physical version of the book but ended up finishing it through Audible. Nick Button-Brown does an excellent job narrating and additional commentary sections have been added specifically for the audiobook. These extras include actual snippets of Paananen and such providing commentary on the contents of the chapters. 

The extra content of course creates some fear-of-missing-out for the readers. On the other hand, this feels like a book you might want to come back to so maybe the readable book is the safest choice here if you have to pick one.

### TLDR

Overall, I can recommend the book for industry professionals and enthusiasts, even if you are not a leader yourself.
