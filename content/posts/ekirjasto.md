The New Year brought some unfortunate news for book readers in the Helsinki capital region: You cannot loan ebooks at Helmet libraries and read them on your ereader anymore. Instead, you need to use the new E-library app.

The same goes for audiobooks: you have to use E-library instead of Libby. Some audiobooks are also available through Naxos Spoken Word Library.

This is a consequence of Helsinki Metropolitan Area Libraries joining the joint E-library service of Finnish municipalities. In the transition, they dropped support for Ellibs and OverDrive as of January 1st 2025.

The E-library application has some limitations for both ebooks and audiobooks. The search and filtering functionalities seem limited, and so does the selection of books in English. 

For avid ebook readers, lack of support for transferring books to e.g. Kobo readers is definitely a big turn-off. I used to use this feature a lot. I understand the joint service has some benefits, but they might be lost on me because of this change.

Similarly, I did use Libby for audiobooks a lot when I was on parental leave but I have since migrated to the commercial services.
