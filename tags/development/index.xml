      <description>This is a blog post I made on my old blog back in 2016. To be completely honest, I am not using Inkscape to make presentations anymore, mostly because I did not like using the app on a Mac in the first place. Nevertheless, maybe somebody still finds this interesting!
Besides death and taxes, there is another thing that is pretty sure in life: you will have to present stuff. This is especially true in the academic world.</description>

      <title>Learning by doing: Setting up a website with Hugo and GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>I just set up this website with GitHub Pages and Hugo so why not share that experience on that very website? It only makes sense!
Somewhat irrelevant background information I have tried a variety of blogging platforms (e.g. Wordpress) in the past but I never got around to creating or hosting a website myself. Doing something like that sounded interesting for learning purposes, so why not try it out?
Well, to be honest, I am not really &amp;ldquo;creating&amp;rdquo; the website myself now either because I ended up using Hugo, nor am I actually hosting it myself as I opted for using GitHub Pages.</description>

      <description>Cars in Finland The Finnish Transport and Communications Agency Traficom shares some open datasets on their website. Here we are going to be looking at open data for vehicles.
Maybe we can learn something about the cars people drive in Finland?
Start with the mandatory imports I will be using Pandas for processing the data and Seaborn-Matplotlib combo for any visualizations.
import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns.</description>
