      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a blog post I made on my old blog back in 2016. To be completely honest, I am not using Inkscape to make presentations anymore, mostly because I did not like using the app on a Mac in the first place. Nevertheless, maybe somebody still finds this interesting!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides death and taxes, there is another thing that is pretty sure in life: you will have to present stuff. This is especially true in the academic world. Since the beginning of my PhD project, I was struggling to find a good tool for preparing the presentations. There were some boundary conditions: I would prefer to prepare them on my Linux computer, have the output in PDF, and make it look nice. I tried Open Office (or Libre Office), Latex and Prezi amongst other things, but about a year ago I found my true match, and that is Inkscape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
